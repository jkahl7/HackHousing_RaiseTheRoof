			<strong>Challenge and Approach</strong></p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;Challenge: Find the the right home in the right neighborhood for the right price/affordability.</p>
		<p>
			Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Use relevant datasets from HUD to get critical information like Affordability and Amenities.</li>
			<li>
				Build a user friendly UI and use algorithms that work with Datasets to refine the results.</li>
			<li>
				Recommend the user a list of the programs that fits their profile.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
